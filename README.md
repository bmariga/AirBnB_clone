# CONSOLE

# Description of the Projects

This is a command-line console for managing data using the HBNB (HomeBnB) application's models. 

It provides a command-line interface to create, show, update, and delete instances of different classes, such as BaseModel, State, City, Amenity, Place, Review, and User.

The console operates based on user inputs and responds by interacting with the underlying models package and storage system. 

It allows the user to perform various actions on instances, such as ```creating new instances```, ```displaying their details```, ```updating attributes```, and ```deleting instances```.

```git clone https://github.com/bmariga/AirBnB_clone.git```

```python3 console.py```

Now you are on interactive mode and the prompt ```hbnb``` will appear:

This command will destroy an instance based on the ID created.
